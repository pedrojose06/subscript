### Subscript Todo List

In this project, I need to implement some features for a simple to-do list, create E2E tests, and style the components.

I’ve listed some features that I think would be interesting to have in this project. They are organized by priority, focusing first on core functionality, then reliability, and finally user experience. Since I only have 90 minutes to implement them, I might adjust the order depending on progress.

First, I will make sure that the components have validations to prevent inserting incorrect data. Then, I will implement core features like managing multiple lists and the ability to open and edit tasks. After that, I’ll start writing Cypress tests to guarantee that everything is working properly.

If I have more time, I will add additional features such as assigning users, login/sign-up functionality, and comments. Finally, I’ll enhance the user experience with features like drag-and-drop tasks, styling improvements, and dark mode.

## Some features that I imagine should be implemented.

- [x] Validation
- [x] Multiple lists
- [ ] Open and edit task
- [x] Cypress tests
- [ ] Assigning users
- [ ] Login/Sign up
- [ ] Add comments
- [ ] Drag and drop tasks
- [x] Styled
- [ ] PWA
- [ ] i18n
- [ ] Dark Mode

### Clone the starter project

You can download or clone this project by running this command from your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/pedrojose06/subscript
```

This will create a directory in the name of the project folder.

Once you have the project files and folders bootstrapped, open it with your text editor.

Next, switch inside the project directory and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies in the local `node_modules` folder.

Finally, start your development server by running:

```
npm start
```

You should see the app in your browser address bar at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
